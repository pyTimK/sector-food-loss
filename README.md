# Identifying which food distribution sector produces the most food waste

This project hopes to tabulate and model how much Food Loss and Waste (FLW) is produced throughout the Food Supply Chain (FSC). Data collected will be used to train a linear regression model to predict food loss for each FSC stage. The results will show at which stages of the FSC produces the most and least amount of waste.
